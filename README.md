# Phone-like
We have created a software that simulates a phone that has applications for contacts, diary, media and messaging.
In this program you can add contacts and delete them from the phonebook, you can send messages to existing contacts and if a contact is deleted all conversations with him are deleted as well.
In addition, in the media app you can watch videos or listen to songs as many as you want or have, in the calender you can set events at what hours you want and delete them if there is an overlap or the event was "canceled".
